# vaadin-builder
A Groovy builder for Vaadin 7

Allows Vaadin UI's to be build using a DSL implemented with a Groovy builder based on the FactoryBuilder pattern. 
The most desirable attributes of this are:

- Homeoiconic UI code
- A bind() operator that dynamically binds a model variable to a UI object data source, allowing automatic bi-directional 
updating ofUI and model

This is a pre-beta version, I would prefer you hold off on forks and pull requests until I release a beta.

Thanks!

Paul.
